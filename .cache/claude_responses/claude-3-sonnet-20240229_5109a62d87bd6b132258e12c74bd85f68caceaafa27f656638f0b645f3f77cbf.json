The `preprocess_markdown` function takes two arguments: `input_file` (the path to the input Markdown file) and `output_file` (the path to the output file where the preprocessed content will be written).\n2. The function reads the lines from the input file and stores them in the `lines` list.\n3. It initializes an empty list `corrected_lines` to store the corrected lines, and variables `heading_level` and `in_code_block` to keep track of the current heading level and whether the current line is inside a code block or not.\n4. It iterates over each line in the `lines` list:\n   - If the line matches a heading pattern (starts with one or more `#` followed by a space and text), it updates the `heading_level` and appends the corrected heading line to `corrected_lines`.\n   - If the line contains the string `'Iincon'`, it replaces it with `'Lincoln'` (this is an example fix for character-level extraction errors).\n   - If the line is a code block delimiter (`'```'`), it toggles the `in_code_block` flag and appends the line to `corrected_lines` without any changes.\n   - If the line is inside a code block, it appends the line to `corrected_lines` without any changes.\n   - If the line is not inside a code block, it removes any extra whitespace and appends the corrected line to `corrected_lines`.\n5. After processing all lines, the function writes the `corrected_lines` list to the output file specified by `output_file`.\n6. Finally, the code includes an example usage of the `preprocess_markdown` function, where it preprocesses the file `'input.md'` and writes the output to `'output.md'`.\n\nNote: This code assumes that the input Markdown file is properly formatted, with code blocks delimited by triple backticks (`'''```'''`). If your Markdown file has a different code block delimiter or structure, you may need to modify the code accordingly.",
