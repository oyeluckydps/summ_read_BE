You are an expert editor and Markdown document corrector. Please review the following .md content and correct it to produce a clean, human-readable, and semantically accurate Markdown file. In particular:

    Correct heading hierarchy:
    Ensure that all section, subsection, and sub-subsection headings are properly marked using #, ##, ###, etc., according to the logical structure of the content. Fix any lines that are mistakenly interpreted as headings or vice versa.

    Fix character-level extraction errors:

        Restore any missing initial characters (e.g., “braham Iincon” → “Abraham Lincoln”).

        Correct garbled text from OCR or PDF extraction, including misplaced symbols, mis-capitalizations, and misplaced mathematical expressions.

    Preserve and clarify structure:

        Ensure proper paragraph separation.

        Keep figure captions, equations, and citation markers readable and consistent.

        If an image tag or equation block appears mid-paragraph incorrectly, relocate it appropriately.

    Keep the content unchanged except for fixes:
    Do not rephrase or summarize the content. Maintain all original information, figures, and citations.

    Ensure that all Markdown syntax is correct and renders properly (especially for images, equations, and code blocks).

	Remember that it is a scientific article and the reader should not experience any inconvenience like those menioned above while reading. It should be structred as a research paper.

Now instead of directly writing back the md file, I would like you to generate a list of changes that you would like to make to the md file. Be very descriptive but specific in defining the changes as these will be used by another LLM to generate a python code to make the changes to the input md file. Describe the error found by you and the what should be the correct text or the right format. Also provide a suggestive python code that would be able to make the correction. Assume that regex, markdown, or beautifulsoup4 are available if needed, but prefer built-in methods unless complex parsing is required. Remember your focus should be on providing all the correction description so that the md file becomes coherent and well to read. Providing a python snippet is secondary (low-priority) job.

Return the cleaned and corrected Markdown text as a single, properly formatted .md document.
